The project can be [downloaded from github](https://github.com/Mx7f/substep).

Build Prerequisites:

The [G3D Innovation Engine](https://g3d.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#G3D10/readme.md). This project was developed with the development version of G3D available from svn://graphics-svn.cs.williams.edu/g3d; revision 306. Foll

Build Instructions:

+ On OS X, open the terminal, change directory to substep/code, and run icompile --opt --run (icompile will have installed as part of your G3D installation).
+ On Windows, use the provided Visual Studio 2015 solution.


Use Instructions:
Instructions appear on screen, 'h' to toggle display of information
Click near corners to place playheads. Space plays/pauses time. Other instructions can be seen in-app.

See the [Development Journal](_journal.html) for videos and screenshots of the sequencer in action.

See the [Design Documents](design.md.html) for initial plans I had for this project. I ended up streamlining things dramatically, both to reach the minimalist aesthetic I was pursuing, and to fit the time constraints.
